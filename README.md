Mazely
======

[Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/) is a visual programming editor created by Neil Fraser at Google. 
One of the provided demos is a maze which can be navigated by using simple
programming techniques to build a solution.

Mazely is my attempt to expand on that demo to provide a simple and fun introduction
to programming for kids.
